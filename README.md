# LeetCode Solutions

This repository contains my solutions to selected LeetCode problems.  
Each solution includes the final code along with a separate write-up explaining the reasoning, approach, and complexity.  
The goal is consistency, pattern recognition, and long-term reference — rather than just storing answers.

---

## Repository Layout

\```
<problem-number>.<problem-title>/
    README.md        # Explanation, thought process, complexity, examples
    solution.*       # Implementation (language may vary: cpp / py / java / etc.)
\```

As more problems are added, directories and indexes will grow accordingly.

---

## Index Overview

This repository will be indexed in two parallel ways:
1. **by problem number range**
2. **by algorithmic category**

Both indexes start small and expand naturally.

## By Problem Range

| Range | Status | Link |
|--------|--------|------|
| 0001 – 0500 | in progress | *(to be populated)* |
| 0501 – 1000 | in progress | *(to be populated)* |
| 1001 – 1500 | in progress | *(to be populated)* |
| 1501 – 2000 | in progress | *(to be populated)* |
| 2001 – 2500 | in progress | *(to be populated)* |
| 2501 – 3000 | in progress | *(to be populated)* |

## Documentation Standards

Each `README.md` inside a problem folder contains:
- problem summary (paraphrased)
- intuition behind the approach
- detailed algorithm steps
- complexity analysis
- examples if needed
- edge-case notes
- code implementation

---

## Why This Repo Exists

- personal reference archive  
- learn patterns instead of isolated answers  
- ensure explanations prove real understanding  
- maintain quality instead of quantity  
- switch languages without breaking structure

---

## Notes

- only problems I choose to solve are included  
- multiple language versions may be added later  
- indexes will expand as more problems are completed
